<h1>Write code for humans first; computers second</h1>
<h2>Great code is easy to read and comprehensible</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Any idiot can write code a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.&rdquo; </p>
<h2>Always be testing</h2>
<p>Great tests are like an instruction manual: they document how your code is meant to be used. Tests also offer verification: if it&rsquo;s not tested, how do we know it works?</p>
<h2>Don&rsquo;t prematurely optimise</h2>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a bottleneck, don&rsquo;t spend time optimising like it is.</p>
<h2>Don&rsquo;t prematurely refactor</h2>
<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE0">&ldquo;Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.&rdquo;</a></p>
<h2>Prefer simple designs</h2>
<p>Build small, self-contained units that are responsible for one thing only. Strive for boringness. Avoid incomprehensible &ldquo;magic&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>We&rsquo;re not interested in being trailblazers</h2>
<p>Keep an eye on trends, but prefer established technologies. Acknowledge the hot new thing, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E">wait for it to mature</a>.</p>

<h1>Make everyone around you better</h1>
<h2>Become a catalyst</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2V7S4U3LX4Y00%26keywords=give%2Band%2Btake%2Bbook%26qid=1557334490%26s=gateway%26sprefix=gift%2Bcard%252Caps%252C302%26sr=8-3">helping everyone around you improve</a>, you become exponentially better than simply the sum of your working hours.</p>
<h2>Communicate Clearly</h2>
<p>Communicate pragmatically &amp; clearly. Don&rsquo;t assume people know what you know. We love bullet points. </p>
<h2>We are all peers</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve been here for a decade or a day, your input is sought. When everyone participates in the process, everyone learns - (for example, in peer review) from the author, to the reviewer, to the bystander silently reading a comment thread.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Protect our users, protect our product</h1>
<h2>Protect our users&rsquo; data</h2>
<p>Be proactive in securing your own work. Be diligent in securing others&rsquo; work.</p>
<h2>Protect our users&rsquo; privacy</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expose any personal data we don&rsquo;t need to, <a href="https://vimeo.com/68470326">no matter how insignificant it may seem</a>.</p>
<h2>Protect our users&rsquo; time</h2>
<p>Users can choose to up and leave to a competitor within seconds. Don&rsquo;t give them time to consider this by shipping frustratingly slow software.</p>
<h2>Resist change that would compromise the above</h2>
<p>You are the final layer between ideas and the user. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to resist change requests: argue passionately, but respectfully. Explain yourself, cite precedent, offer alternatives, but above all respect the original motivation.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Have fun</h1>
<h2>Optimise for programmer happiness</h2>
<p>Our primary tool is Ruby. We identify with the language because it is <a href="https://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html">designed around human needs</a>, not computer needs. It is explicitly optimised for programmer happiness and we should strive to continue that trend in our own work.</p>
<h2>Homogeneous teams are boring</h2>
<p>Let your personality show in how you interact with others, and let it show in your work.</p>
<h2>Art is welcome</h2>
<p>Programming is a science, but our work needn&rsquo;t always be antiseptic. <a href="http://antirez.com/news/123">A little artistry can be refreshing, sometimes</a>. But remember, <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?RealArtistsShip">&rdquo;real artists ship&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2>Workaholics aren&rsquo;t heroes</h2>
<p>They don&rsquo;t save the day, they just use it up. People rarely solve problems by brute-forcing them with sheer hours. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/workaholics-arent-heroes-cb479582dd97">Workaholics aren&rsquo;t heroes</a>.</p>
